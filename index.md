## About LIQCS

**LIQCS** is a workshop dedicated to the logical and mathematical foundations of
quantum computer science.  
Its goal is to bring together researchers working on rigorous frameworks for
quantum computation, including logic, type theory,
semantics, algebraic and categorical methods, and formal verification.

The workshop welcomes contributions presenting new ideas, work in progress,
recently published results, and perspectives on emerging research directions.

## Topics of Interest

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Mathematical and logical methods for quantum computation  
- Interactions between quantum information theory and logic  
- Type systems for quantum programming languages  
- Models of quantum computation: lambda calculi, term rewriting systems, process calculi, etc.
- Denotational, operational, and categorical semantics of languages/logics for quantum computing
- Logics for verification and reasoning about quantum programs and protocols  
- Realisability, game semantics, and algebraic models for quantum systems  
- Formal methods for quantum and hybrid quantum–classical systems  
- Mathematical and logical aspects of quantum cryptography  

If in doubt about the suitability of your submission, feel free to contact the organisers.
